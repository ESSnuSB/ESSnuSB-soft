#   This is helper file for the environmental variables required to run EsbRoot software
#
#   These are just examples, you can adjust the folder content as you deem appropriate
#   Having this structure the environmental variables required are:

export INSTALL_PATH=/** Absolute path **/
export SIMPATH=$INSTALL_PATH/fairsoft
export PATH=$SIMPATH/bin:$PATH

export FAIRROOTPATH=$INSTALL_PATH/fairroot

export GENIE=/** Absolute path **/Genie/Genie-Generator
export PATH=$PATH:$GENIE/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$GENIE/lib

export ROOTSYS=/** Absolute path **/fairsoft

#for 64 bit Pythia6
#export PYTHIA6=/** Absolute path **/fairsoft/lib64 

#for 32 bit Pythia6
export PYTHIA6=/** Absolute path **/fairsoft/lib

export CSFILE=/** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB-soft/EsbGenerators/xsec/xsec_essnusb.xml

#For the examples in GenFit
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/** Absolute path to GenFit build folder **/

export GENFIT_HOME=/** Absolute path to main GenFit folder **/
export GENFIT_INCLUDE=$GENFIT_HOME
export GENFIT_LIBRARY=/** Absolute path to the build GenFit folder **/


export PATHFINDER_INC=/** Absolute path to PathFinder sources **/include
export PATHFINDER_LIB=/** Absolute path to the build folder of PathFinder **/lib

# To use the envs file
# 1. Replace the /** Absolute path **/ with the path on you local machine
# 2. Type (logged in as administrator) in the command prompt in the folder of the envs file
#       $chmod +x envs
# 3. Type (logged in as administrator) in the command prompt
#    $source ./envs 
# 4. Navigate to "/** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB-soft/build"
# 5. Type (logged in as administrator) in the command prompt
#    $source ./config.sh
#
#  All required variables should not be set. To run the macro files, each macro file 
#  may require paths to additional files, these should be populated manually for each 
#  macro file - they are independent from the required environmental variables.
#
# For FGD detector additional settings - number of cubes in X,Y,Z direction,
#   size of cubes, magnetic field inside FGD detector etc.
#   Are located in [EsbRoot directory]/EsbGeometry/EsbSuperFGD/EsbConfig/geometry

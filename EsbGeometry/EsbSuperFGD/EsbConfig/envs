#   This is helper file for the environmental variables required to run EsbRoot software
#   To help for the folder structure, it is divided into the following
#   -> EsbRoot software is in folder "ESSnuSB_soft"
#   -> EsbRoot dependencies and build folders (FairRoot, Genie etc.) are located in "ESSnuSB_deps"
#
#   These are just examples, you can adjust the folder content as you deem appropriate
#   Having this structure the environmental variables required are
#
# Paths to easy the navigation of in the environmental variables
#1. FairSoft source files  
#           /** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB_deps/FairSoft_src
#2. FairSoft installation
#           /** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB_deps/fairsoft
#3. FairRoot source files
#           /** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB_deps/FairRoot_src
#4. FairRoot installation        
#           /** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB_deps/fairroot
#5. Genie sources
#           /** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB_deps/Genie/Genie-Generator
#6. Genfit sources
#           /** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB_deps/GenFit
#7. Pathfinder sources
#           /** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB_deps/Pathfinder_src

# To use the envs file
# 1. Replace the /** Absolute path **/ with the path on you local machine
# 2. Type (logged in as administrator) in the command prompt in the folder of the envs file
#       $chmod +x envs
# 3. Type (logged in as administrator) in the command prompt
#    $source ./envs 
# 4. Navigate to "/** Absolute path **/ESSnuSB-soft/build"
# 5. Type (logged in as administrator) in the command prompt
#    $source ./config.sh

#  All required variables should not be set. To run the macro files, each macro file 
#  may require paths to additional files, these should be populated manually for each 
#  macro file - they are independent from the required environmental variables.

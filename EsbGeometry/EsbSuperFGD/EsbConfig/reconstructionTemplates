# This holds the tempaltes used to identify leafs and next hit to traverge when using a graph
#   for track identification.
#   The syntax is the following:
#   First row defines whether the next is a template for a Leaf of for next node - Leaf or GetNextNode respectively.
#   We use local hits, this the cubes size is 3x3x3 with the current hit in the middle.
#   To define the template the first 9 are the cubes at Z-1 coordinates, than at Z and than at Z+1.
#   'O' (letter O) is used for no hit, 'X' is for hit, 'P' is used in GetNextNode templates to denote previous node
#   'N' is used in GetNextNode templates to denote next node. ONE space is used to separate the matrixes

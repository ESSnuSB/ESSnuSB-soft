# How to use

Since the macros create quite a lot of files, not 
to clutter the macro folder follow these steps:

1. Create a folder "test" located under the EsbMacro folder.

2. Execute the macros as

```
root -l ../EsbSuperFGD/<macro_file>.C 
```

where <macro_file> is e.g. simulate_1_fgd_genie_generator.C 
root -l ../EsbSuperFGD/simulate_1_fgd_genie_generator.C
